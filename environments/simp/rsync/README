This directory should have the following structure for the associated
simp::server::rsync_shares class to work properly:

Globals => Any shares that are not bound by OS specific issues
<OperatingSystem>/<MajorRelease> => Shares that are specific to the OS and release

No other directory structure is supported at this time
