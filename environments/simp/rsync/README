This directory should have the following structure for the associated
simp::server::rsync_shares class to work properly:

Globals => Any shares that are not bound by OS specific issues
<OperatingSystem>/<MajorRelease> => Shares that are specific to the OS and release

No other directory structure is supported at this time

## Updating The Shares

Care must be taken with updating the rsync shares in a SIMP system.

In particular, you need to ensure that any directory where rsync will be
sharing content contains a `.shares` file.

This structure is used by the `simp_rsync_environments` fact to provide the
Puppet server with an understanding of what has the potential of being shared
out on the sysetm and where it is located. This means that you can easily move
your rsync shares to other servers and that they are not bound to the Puppet
server.

See the HOWTO on working with Rsync shares in the main SIMP documentation for a
full description and examples.
