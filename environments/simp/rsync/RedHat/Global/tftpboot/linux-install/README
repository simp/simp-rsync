You will need to copy the pxelinux.0 and the appropriate kickstart images for
your systems into this directory as well as the 'msgs' directory from your
distribution.

By default, each set of files should be placed into a directory of the form
'operatingsystem-version-architecture'.

For Example:

'RHEL 6 x86_64' would be 'rhel-6-x86_64'
