This directory contains the boot, kernel, and root filesystem files
for PXE booting clients.

* The kernel and root filesystem files for each OS, should be placed
  into a directory of the form 'operatingsystem-version-architecture'.
  For example for CentOS 7.8.2003 x86_64

    centos-7.8.2003-x86_64/initrd.img
    centos-7.8.2003-x86_64/TRANS.TBL
    centos-7.8.2003-x86_64/vmlinuz

* If you are not using the tftpboot module to populate boot files
  on the tftboot server (i.e., have explictly set `tftpboot::use_os_files`
  to `false`), you will also need to include the boot files appropriate
  for the OS of the tftpboot server. The EFI boot files should be in an
  efi directory.  For example, for CentOS 7, these files would be:

    menu.c32
    pxelinux.0
    efi/grubx64.efi
    efi/shim.efi
